## FAQ

**Why isn't this in the WordPress.org Plugins Repository?**

Two reasons:  1. It's R-rated, and 2. It contains tons of copyrighted images, so use at your own peril.

**Why is this plugin so huge?**

It contains lots of fun images.  If you want to reduce its size, just delete some of the images.  The plugin will compensate automatically.
